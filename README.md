## Installation

`npm i nrc-next-carousel`

### For Tailwind 3

In your tailwind.config.ts, add
`"./node_modules/nrc-next-carousel/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"`

like...

```ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

export default {
    content: [
        "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
        "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
        "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
        "./node_modules/nrc-next-carousel/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    theme: {
        screens: {
            sm: "28rem",
        },
        extend: {
            colors: {
                background: "var(--background)",
                foreground: "var(--foreground)",
            },
        },
    },
    plugins: [],
} satisfies Config;
```

### For Tailwind 4

Add this line to the top of your .css file that imports Tailwind.

If you're using the `src` directory (`/src/app/globals.css`):

```css
@source "../../node_modules/nrc-next-carousel/dist";
```

If you're **not** using the `src` directory (`/app/globals.css`):

```css
@source "../node_modules/nrc-next-carousel/dist";
```

## Usage

```tsx
"use client";

import { Carousel } from "nrc-next-carousel";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <>
            <Carousel
                breakpoint="sm"
                frames={[
                    {
                        desktop: {
                            image: {
                                src: "...",
                                width: 1792,
                                height: 600,
                                alt: "frog band",
                            },
                        },
                        mobile: {
                            image: {
                                src: "...",
                                width: 640,
                                height: 800,
                                alt: "frog band",
                            },
                        },
                    },
                ]}
            />
        </>
    );
}
```

## Documentation

I plan to have more documentation in the future, and this will eventually be updated with that link. Everything should work exactly how you think it works, so my hope is that this documentation is not needed. This package is **mobile-first opinionated** meaning "mobile" is treated as default. If you are not taking advantage of the breakpoint system, you will be using the props called "mobile". If there is something that is not clear in this documentation, you might be able to find a solution by reading the .stories file in the source code for examples of prop configurations.

### Carousel Props

The Carousel is made up of Frames which can be images, React components, or both (more on that later). The size of these frames is controlled by the aspect ratio of the image of your first Frame, therefore it's best practice to use images of the same aspect ratio to avoid stretching (alternatively you can use the `heights` prop to control the sizes of the frames).

The `loadingComponent` is what will appear before the blurUrl is loaded. This defaults to a pulsating gray colored div.

If you want to turn off automatic pausing when the user has their mouse hovering on the carousel, you can set `willPauseOnHover` to `false`.

You can adjust the `slideDuration` to change the auto-play speed. And turn off auto-play with `noAutoPlay`. If the carousel should continue to auto-play even if the carousel is not in the viewport, you can use `willAutoPlayOutsideViewport`.

You can turn off the default blur with `noBlur`. You can adjust the default quality of the initial blur image by using the `blurQuality` prop (use a number between 1-100). The larger the number, the better looking the image, but the worse the load time.

The `controlsComponent` will be an optional function that returns a React component. It sits inside the Carousel component (a position:relative section) and can be used to create custom controls for your Carousel. This package has no opinion on controls, so this is left completely up to the user in terms of UI/UX. Your component will receive `incrementCarousel`, `decrementCarousel`, `currentIndex` and `jumpTo` props. [Check this story](https://carousel.nicholasrussellconsulting.com/?path=/story/nrccarousel--with-controls) for an example.

### Frames

The `key` prop is only needed if you are not using images (or your images have the same src for some reason).

You will see there is responsive architecture here, and you can use both `mobile` & `desktop` inside each Frame. If you are only using one, use `mobile`.

### NRC Image

I strongly recommend you provide your own `alt`, especially if you are building a marketing/ecomm site.

`imageFocalPoint` should be self-explanatory if you're familiar with the concept.

### NRC Frame Component

This will be either a React component, or a function that returns a React component. If it's a function, it will receive the `incrementCarousel`, `decrementCarousel`, and `jumpTo` props.

The component will be inside an absolute positioned container with full width and height of the Frame.

## Common Issues

> ❌ **Error:** Error: Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components unless you explicitly expose it by marking it with "use server". Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it.

This occurs if you do not have a "use client" directive in the file where you are defining a React Component to pass to the carousel (`controlsComponent` for example)
